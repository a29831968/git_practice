<Can not push>
# while the remote is newer than your local

Solution 1 :
$ git pull (--rebase)
# if there is no conflict, then you can push
$ git push

Solution 2 :
$ git push -f	// this is force

<Want to update to the newest version that you previously work>
# When you fork the project and send the PR, there might be some other
# people they have already send PR and be received
# so you need to update to your local

Solution 1 :
Delete the one you fork and before and fork again

Solution 2 :
$ git remote -v	//s show all the remote node you have set up
$ git remote add upstream <HTTPS/SSH>	// another remote node to Author's project
$ git fetch upstream	// fetch the commit
$ git merge upstream/master

$ git push origin master	// this depends on if you want to update the project on your GitHub


<Delete Remote Branches>
$ git push origin :cat
# Which is
$ git push origin master:cat	// without master
# Just like you push a empty branch


<$ git push -f>
No matter what, just push it.
But, you can goto the setting to choose what branch you want to protect
And if you want to save the file, just let the peope who has previous commit record
$ git push -f 
again
